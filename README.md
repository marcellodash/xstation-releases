# xstation-releases

Head over to [the releases page](https://github.com/x-station/xstation-releases/releases) to download the latest updates.   

If this is the first time setting up your SD card, follow this short guide:   
- create a folder named "00xstation" on your card (this is the xstation system directory)   
- firmware updates (update.bin) and the loader application (loader.bin) go into this folder   
- copy your games to the SD card   
- try to avoid having more than about 150 items per folder, otherwise scanning the card for games becomes slow   
- it helps to organize games in folders for their starting letter (0-a, b, c, .. y, z, etc)
